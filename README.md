This project was built by following Baraa’s SQL Data Warehouse course. It was completed with the goal of learning and practicing data warehousing concepts, ETL processes, and staging architecture (Bronze–Silver–Gold).

All data, logic, and structure are based on the course material. I used this as a foundational project before building my own data pipeline from scratch.
